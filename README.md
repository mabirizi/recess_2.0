Founded in 2008, Stack Overflow is the largest, most trusted online community for developers to learn, share their knowledge, and build their careers. More than 50 million professional and aspiring programmers visit Stack Overflow each month to help solve coding problems, develop new skills, and find job opportunities.

Stack Overflow partners with businesses to help them understand, hire, engage, and enable the world's developers. Our products and services are focused on developer marketing, technical recruiting, market research, and enterprise knowledge sharing. 
Each year, Stack Overflow asks the developer community about everything from their favorite technologies to their job preferences. This year marks the eighth year Stack Overflow has published their Annual Developer Survey results—with the largest number of respondents yet. Over 100,000 developers took the 30-minute survey in January 2018.
There are 98,855 responses in this public data release. These responses are what are consider “qualified” for analytical purposes based on completion and time spent on the survey and included at least one non-PII question. Approximately 20,000 responses were started but not included here because respondents did not answer enough questions, or only answered questions with personally identifying information. Of the qualified responses, 67,441 completed the entire survey.
The project management team intends to analyze these results and deduce what can be learnt about salaries or machine learning or diversity in tech. This analysis could help Stack Overflow improve on service delivery such as developer marketing, technical recruiting, market research and enterprise knowledge sharing.
